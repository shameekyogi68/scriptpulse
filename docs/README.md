ScriptPulse v1.3.1

ScriptPulse is a deterministic system for detecting structural strain
in screenplays using non-semantic textual features and rule-based
temporal accumulation.

The system analyzes screenplay structure only.
It does not interpret meaning, judge quality, or understand narrative.

Version: v1.3.1 (frozen)
Status: Research-grade, deterministic, reproducible
